## PR review checklist

- [] Selectors are not matching multiple elements
- [] Changes are passing in all environments
- [] No `page.waitForTimeout` used; auto-retrying assertions are preferred
- [] Tests use user-facing locators (e.g., `getByRole`, `getByText`) instead of CSS/XPath where possible
- [] Test names are descriptive and follow the project conventions
- [] Page Object Model is used for reusability and maintenance
- [] No `console.log`, `debugger`, or `page.pause()` left in the code
- [] Tests are independent and can run in parallel
- [] Data created during tests is properly cleaned up
- [] Code is properly formatted and passes linting rules
- [] Assertions are specific and use web-first assertions (e.g., `toBeVisible`)
- [] Tests have been run locally to ensure no flakiness
